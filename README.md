# Krieger Digital - SET HOMEWORK
This project contains the solution implemented by Juan Mu√±oz for the Krieger digital set homework.

## Overview
For this development was used the IntelliJ IDE to create an automation for the KD test, the language used was Java (11) and to manage the dependencies was used Gradle (v 6.8.3). Probably the MVP for this automation can be achieved with a simpler solution, but the intention was also create a complete and scalable solution/framework.
